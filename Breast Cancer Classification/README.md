# **Breast Cancer Dataset from Scikit-learn**

## **Description:**

The Breast Cancer dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning, particularly for classification tasks.
It consists of features extracted from images of digitized breast masses. The goal is to predict whether a given mass is benign or malignant.

## **Features:**

The dataset includes 30 numerical features, each representing a different characteristic of the mass. These features are derived from measurements of the mass's perimeter, area, radius, texture, and other properties.

## **Target:**

The target variable is a binary class label indicating whether the mass is *benign (0)* or *malignant (1)*.

## **Usage:**

The Breast Cancer dataset is often used as a starting point for exploring machine learning algorithms and techniques. It provides a relatively small but well-characterized dataset that can be used to experiment with different models and evaluate their performance.

## **Scikit-learn Implementation:**

`Scikit-learn` provides a convenient way to load and use the Breast Cancer dataset. The `load_breast_cancer()` function returns a `Bunch` object containing the data and target variables, as well as additional metadata.
